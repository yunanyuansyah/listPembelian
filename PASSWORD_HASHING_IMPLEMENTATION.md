# Password Hashing Implementation

This document describes the password hashing implementation that has been added to the application.

## Overview

The application now uses bcryptjs for secure password hashing instead of storing passwords in plain text. This provides better security for user authentication.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Password Hashing Utilities (`src/lib/password.ts`)

- **`hashPassword(password: string)`**: Hashes a plain text password using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **`comparePassword(password: string, hashedPassword: string)`**: Compares a plain text password with a hashed password
- **`validatePassword(password: string)`**: Validates password strength with the following requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### 2. Updated Database Functions (`src/lib/db.ts`)

- **`createUser()`**: Now hashes passwords before storing them in the database
- **`verifyUser()`**: Now compares plain text passwords with hashed passwords using bcrypt
- **`updateUser()`**: Hashes passwords when updating user information

### 3. Updated API Endpoints

- **Registration API** (`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`):
  - Validates password strength before creating users
  - Passwords are automatically hashed by the `createUser()` function
- **Login API** (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`):
  - Uses secure password comparison with bcrypt

### 4. Migration System

- **Migration Script** (`src/lib/migrate-passwords.ts`):

  - Converts existing plain text passwords to hashed passwords
  - Includes safety checks to prevent double-hashing
  - Provides status checking functionality

- **Migration API** (`src/app/api/migrate-passwords/route.ts`):

  - GET endpoint to check migration status
  - POST endpoint to run the migration

- **Migration Page** (`src/app/migrate-passwords/page.tsx`):
  - Admin interface to check migration status and run migration
  - Accessible at `/migrate-passwords`

## Security Benefits

1. **Password Protection**: Passwords are no longer stored in plain text
2. **Salt Rounds**: Uses 12 salt rounds for bcrypt (recommended for production)
3. **Password Validation**: Enforces strong password requirements
4. **Secure Comparison**: Uses bcrypt's built-in comparison function to prevent timing attacks

## Migration Process

### For Existing Users

1. **Check Migration Status**: Visit `/migrate-passwords` or call `GET /api/migrate-passwords`
2. **Run Migration**: Use the migration page or call `POST /api/migrate-passwords`
3. **Verify**: Check that all users can still login with their original passwords

### Important Notes

- **Backup First**: Always backup your database before running migration
- **One-Time Operation**: Migration should only be run once
- **User Experience**: Users can continue using their original passwords after migration
- **Admin Access**: Migration page should be protected or removed after migration

## Dependencies Added

- `bcryptjs`: For password hashing and comparison
- No additional type definitions needed (bcryptjs includes its own types)

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:

- Passwords are properly hashed
- Password comparison works correctly
- Password validation enforces security requirements
- Migration system functions properly

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New User

```typescript
import { createUser } from "@/lib/db";

const newUser = await createUser({
  nama: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  password: "SecurePass123!", // Will be automatically hashed
  nomor: "1234567890",
  status: "user",
});
```

### Verifying User Login

```typescript
import { verifyUser } from "@/lib/db";

const user = await verifyUser("john@example.com", "SecurePass123!");
// Password comparison is handled securely with bcrypt
```

### Manual Password Hashing

```typescript
import { hashPassword, comparePassword } from "@/lib/password";

const hashedPassword = await hashPassword("MyPassword123!");
const isValid = await comparePassword("MyPassword123!", hashedPassword);
```

## Security Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure database credentials are properly secured
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production to protect password transmission
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on login endpoints
4. **Session Management**: Consider implementing proper session management
5. **Password Reset**: Implement secure password reset functionality
6. **Audit Logging**: Log authentication attempts for security monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- Implement password reset functionality
- Add two-factor authentication
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add password history to prevent reuse
- Implement session management with JWT tokens
